Gramazio & Kholer

When I am doing my research about Architecture Robotics a name that always show up is “Gramazio & Kohler”.

They are professors from the University of ETH in Zurique.Their research is amazing! In all this years they made a lot of wonderful things. I found this video that shows a lit bit what they had done.

<p><a href="https://vimeo.com/149328392">One decade of Gramazio Kohler Research at ETH Zurich &ndash; The Architecture of Digital Fabrication</a> from <a href="https://vimeo.com/user14316338">Gramazio Kohler Research</a> on <a href="https://vimeo.com">Vimeo</a>.</p>

I am sure that they can be a good source to my research.
