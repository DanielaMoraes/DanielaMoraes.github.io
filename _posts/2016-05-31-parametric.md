**Parametric Robot Control?**

The conference of Robotics Architecture has a lot of articles about how people use software as Rhino and its plug-ins as Grasshopper to design and help machines to build their project.

According with Johannes Braumann and Sigrid Brell-Cokcan, the multifunctionality of Grasshopper can be compared to the multifunctionality of an industrial robot where the designer can plug and unplug different tools like milling-cutters for robot milling or gripping tools for bricklaying. It allows the expectation that the presented KUKA|prc component in this paper is modifiable to achieve a wide variety of robot applications by simple plugging and unplugging different geometric solutions or tool constraints, enabling us to integrate industrial robots in CAAD and move beyond CAD/CAM as we know it .
