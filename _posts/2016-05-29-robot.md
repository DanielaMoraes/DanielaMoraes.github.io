**How humans respond to robots**

I am interested in how humans respond to robots. How the appearance and the behavior of a robot can change our relationship with them. If their purpose can change how we relate with them.

In the article “How Humans respond to robots” from Heather Knight, she explains about how we change our behavior according with the relationship that we have with a robot. She says “Since the beginning In fact, as social creatures, it is often our default behavior to anthropomorphize moving robots.”
She gives an example from a bomb-disposal robot that damage by an explosion and the soldiers asked to the company fix that exactly same robot, instead of replace for a new one. They wanted the one that has shared experiences with, bonded with, and the one they did not want to “die”.
I want to design a robot that people will actually want to use and engage with it.
