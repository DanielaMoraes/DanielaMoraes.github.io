**TRASH CAN ROBOT**

I was happy and sad at the same time when I found this robot. One of my ideas was to create a robot that finds trash on the floor, and tried to call attention of people around so they could put the trash on a can.
This robot does the same thing. The Sociable Trash Box robots were created by researchers at the Interaction and Communication Design Lab at Aichi Prefecture’s Toyohashi University of Technology. The purpose of the robot trash can is to detect trash that has been discarded on the ground where people happen to be located through the use of its onboard camera and multiple sensors. Once the Sociable Trash Box robot detects garbage in an area with people, it moves around in an attempt to get people’s attention in order to get someone to place the garbage inside of it.
