**Digital Materiality**

I was reading this article “Digital Materiality in Architecture”-from Gramazio & Kohler and I found out this new word  **“Digital Materiality”**.

According with Gramazio & Kohler Digital Materiality evolves through the interplay between digital and material processes in the design and construction.
With the techniques of digital fabrication, the architect will be able not to just design their project, but also participate and create the fabrication process. All these were accomplished by the use of plug-in as Grasshoper and machines as Kuka.

This opens a new way of design. More organic(free form), creative, beautiful and challenge way never seem before.
