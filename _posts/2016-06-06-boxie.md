**BOXIE**

Another cute robot which interacts with people. This robot was created by Alex Reben from MIT. 
'Boxie' the robot was designed to get 'stuck' (the least challenging part of this project) and ask for help when it sensed people nearby - a 'cute' voice, appearance and demeanor were designed to encourage human engagement. Boxie would then engage people in a structured dialog, thereby producing something like a digitally annotated interview.

A filmmaker can then take Boxie's clips and easily put them together to craft a story about the place in which Boxie was set loose. Boxie logged data from an array of embedded sensors, including an accelerometer, which indicated how 'roughly' the robot was treated.This was the results:
