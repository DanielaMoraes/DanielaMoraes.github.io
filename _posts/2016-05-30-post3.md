What and how?

**What is architecture?**

Define architecture is one of the hardest things to do because what is created with architecture is not just art or/and building. Architecture it’s the product of a thoughtful idea that, according with Louis Kahn, is reaching out for the truth.
It’s the space carefully thought so that touches and reach people’s feelings. It’s the encounter between beauty and essence. It’s the empty space being filled with meanings. It’s where look finds the importance of details. It’s the bond between humans and buildings.
Architecture is space, time, essence, thought, beauty, emotions... it’s life.
