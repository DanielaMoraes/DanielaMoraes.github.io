**Jibo- The first social robot for home**

When I am thinking about robots, I always get attract and excited of how they can interact with people and kind of create a relationship with us. During my researches I found this robot called Jibo, created by a professor from MIT, Dr. Cynthia Breazeal.

It’s so cute, and he works like a social robot. It talks, take pictures, remind you to do things or even tell stories.

It’s adorable, especially when it makes cute faces on the lcd scream. Like the advertisement, it’s like it is a new member of the family. The “it” becomes “he”.

I really would like to create a robot that it’s functional and that creates a bond with **his** owner.
